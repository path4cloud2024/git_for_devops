🧠 How CODEOWNERS Works
        Example scenario:
            PR modifies files in /infra/
            GitHub automatically:
            Requests review from @devops-team
            Blocks merge until at least one DevOps member approves
            Even if:
                ✔ CI passed
                ✔ Other reviewers approved

    👉 Code Owner approval is mandatory

🔐 Why CODEOWNERS is important
| Benefit    | Why it matters                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Ownership  | Clear responsibility            |
| Security   | Prevents unauthorized changes   |
| Expertise  | Right people review the code    |
| Governance | Mandatory for infra & prod code |
