🐞 GitHub Issues – Explained
    GitHub Issues are used to track work, problems, ideas, and discussions related to a repository from external people.
    They act like a lightweight project management system built directly into GitHub.

        🐛 Bugs
        ✨ Feature requests
        📄 Documentation tasks

        ✔ Easy collaboration and discussion
        ✔ History and audit trail
