---> Merge conflict:
            When same files were edited in both branches.
            Plan:
                a. Create a new feature branch from the main/master branch
                b. Make changes in one file and commit
                c. checkout to main/master branch
                d. Make changes in same file and commit
                e. Now, try to merge, it will land to conflict now.

            Auto-merging a.txt
            CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in a.txt
            Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

            If you check the status:

            git status
            On branch master
            You have unmerged paths.
            (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
            (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

            Unmerged paths:
            (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
                    both modified:   a.txt

            no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

        ** Solving merge conflict:
            If VS Code then, in a conflict file, it shows the difference and give an option as:
            - Accept Current change (from master branch)
            - Accept Incoming change (from feature branch)
            - Accept Both change

        ** Solving merger in terminal:
            user vim or another editor and get inside the file:
            - check the changes coming from HEAD (from main branch)
            - check the changes coming from <new_branch>
            - decide which one you want to keep, original, from new_branch or both
            - once modified then save the file and add the filr to stage area
            - conflict will be resolved.
