Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used to track changes in source code and collaborate with others.
✅ What Git Does
    Git helps you:
    1. Track changes
        Every time you edit files, you can save a “snapshot” (called a commit).
        You can go back to older versions anytime.
    2. Work in parallel
        Multiple developers can work on the same project using branches without affecting each other.
    3. Collaborate easily
        Using platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, you can push/pull code and manage teamwork.

💡 Why Do We Use Git? (Real-world benefits)
“Git is used by every IT company because…”

    ✅ You can track all changes
    ✅ You can work in teams without overwriting each other
    ✅ You can create branches for new features
    ✅ You can roll back if something breaks
    ✅ You can deploy code directly from Git
    ✅ It integrates with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, ArgoCD etc.

🛠️ How Git Works (High-level Understanding)
    “Git works in three main areas:”
    - Working Directory – your actual files
    - Staging Area – files you are preparing to commit
    - Repository – where Git stores your permanent changes
    
    ** “When you modify a file → add it to staging → commit it → the commit is permanently stored in the repo.”
    - Basic Git Flow
        git init            # Create git repository
        git status          # Check status
        git add .           # Stage changes
        git commit -m "msg" # Save snapshot
        git push            # Upload to remote repo
        git pull            # Get latest changes
        git branch          # Manage branches
        git merge           # Merge branches

✅ Real-world Example
    Imagine you’re working on a project:
    You create a feature branch
    Make changes
    Commit the changes
    Push to GitHub
    Create a Pull Request
    Team reviews → approves → merges to main

✅ Repository Types:
    Local
    Remote
